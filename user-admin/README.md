⚠️ **IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL** ⚠️

This service is part of a unified user certificate system and has critical dependencies. The user-groups and related tables have been carefully configured to maintain referential integrity with user requests. Any modifications to the database schema or core functionality must be explicitly approved and coordinated with the entire system.

Key Points:
- The service maintains critical user group relationships
- Database schema changes may affect other services
- Changes must be coordinated with user-request and cert-admin services
