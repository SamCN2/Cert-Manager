### [ISSUE-001] Direct Validation Token Entry Not Working
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Identified in Version:** v0.1.0  
**Component:** User Request Service - Validation Flow

**Description:**  
While email link validation is working correctly, direct validation token entry through the form interface is not functioning as expected. Users can successfully validate their email when clicking the link in the email, but entering the same token manually does not work.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Users should be able to enter their validation token manually through a form
- The validation process should work identically whether using the email link or manual entry

**Current Behavior:**  
- Email link validation works correctly (user transitions from pending to active)
- Manual token entry through form interface fails

**Technical Notes:**  
- Email link validation successfully updates user status and marks request as completed
- Investigation needed to ensure form submission handles token validation identically to email link process

**Next Steps:**
1. Compare request handling between email link and form submission
2. Verify token processing logic consistency
3. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
4. Add comprehensive testing for both validation methods
