⚠️ **IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL** ⚠️

This service is part of a unified user certificate system and has critical dependencies. The request handling and user creation flow has been carefully designed to ensure all users have corresponding requests. Any modifications to the database schema or core functionality must be explicitly approved and coordinated with the entire system.

Key Points:
- The service manages the critical user creation flow
- All users must have corresponding requests
- Changes must be coordinated with user-admin and cert-admin services
